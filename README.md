<h1>Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow</h1>

<h2>C2W1_Assignment: Using CNN's with the Cats vs Dogs Dataset</h2>
<p>In this assignment, the famous `Cats vs Dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats.</p>
<code> Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities.</code>

<h2>C2W2_Assignment:  Cats vs Dogs with Data Augmentation</h2>
<p>In this assignment, the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset used to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats.</p>
<code>A Convolutional Neural Network created in Tensorflow and leveraged Keras' image preprocessing utilities, since Keras provides excellent support for augmenting image data.</code>

<h2>C2W3_Assignment: Transfer Learning - Horses vs Humans</h2>
<p>In this exercise,  a technique called `Transfer Learning`  used </p>
<code>`Transfer Learning` technique utilize an already trained network to help you solve a similar problem to the one it was originally trained to solve.</code>

<h2>C2W4_Assignment: Multi-class Classification</h2>
<p>This assignment, a multi-class classification problem solved using the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the English alphabet. </p>
<code> The data pre-processed so that it can be fed into your convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.</code>
